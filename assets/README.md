# Branding Guidelines

Tina is first and foremost an open source project, and as such, we want to make sure that the project is as accessible as possible to everyone. This includes recognisable and popular branding that encourages people to use the project, and contribute to it.

Although it is **not required** to use any Tina branding, we do encourage at least a mention ot it

## "Tina"

Tina (*/tina/*) stands for "Tina is not Aero".

You are allowed to use the name "Tina" in your own projects as long as they USE, IMPLEMENT, COMPLIMENT, or EXTEND the official Tina repository; please do not use the name "Tina" in a way that could be confused with the official Tina project.

## "Tina Framework"

"Tina Framework" is a phrase that refers specifically to this GitHub repository.

You are encouraged to use this over "Tina" in your own projects, as it is more specific and less likely to be confused with the female name *Tina*.

## Icon

The Icon is a pair of blue wings, assumedly those of a fairy named Tina.

You are allowed to use the icon in your own projects as long as they USE, IMPLEMENT, COMPLIMENT, or EXTEND the official Tina repository; please do not alter the icon in any way, and keep it to its original aspect ratio whenever displaying it.

## In-Game

The In-Game Banner features the Icon and the "Tina Framework" phrase written in the same font that is used by the official Aether Interactive Ltd. branding.

This banner is hard to use on Dark Backgrounds, so we recommend using the Banner instead.
