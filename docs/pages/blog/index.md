# Tina - A Project by Aether Interactive

This is a mini-blog about Tina's development.

## Why?

We want to be transparent about the development of Tina, and we want to be able to share our thoughts and ideas with you.

Much of the design of Tina is based on our personal experiences with Roblox, and blogging it all is a nice way to translate and explain our deicisions where possible.
